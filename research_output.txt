Title: Compact non-left-recursive grammars using the selective left-corner transform and factoring
Authors: Mark Johnson, Brian Roark
Summary: The left-corner transform removes left-recursion from (probabilistic) context-free grammars and unification grammars, permitting simple top-down parsing techniques to be used. Unfortunately the grammars produced by the standard left-corner transform are usually much larger than the original. The selective left-corner transform described in this paper produces a transformed grammar which simulates left-corner recognition of a user-specified set of the original productions, and top-down recognition of the others. Combined with two factorizations, it produces non-left-recursive grammars that are not much larger than the original.

The original Transformer paper, titled 'Attention is All You Need,' was published in 2017 by Vaswani et al. This paper introduced the Transformer model, a novel architecture designed to handle sequential data, particularly in the context of natural language processing (NLP). The key innovation of the Transformer is the use of self-attention mechanisms, which allow the model to weigh the importance of input elements with respect to each other, regardless of their distance in the sequence. This approach eliminates the need for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which were previously used for sequential data tasks. The Transformer model has since become a foundational component in many state-of-the-art NLP models, including those used for machine translation, text generation, and more. The paper also introduced several other important concepts, such as positional encoding, which adds information about the position of tokens in the sequence, and multi-head attention, which allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. The Transformer architecture has been widely adopted and has led to significant advancements in the field of NLP and beyond.

Title: Locally-Deployed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning Model in Chemical Engineering: Starting from 30 Experimental Data
Authors: Tianhang Zhou, Yingchun Niu, Xingying Lan, Chunming Xu
Summary: In the field of chemical engineering, traditional data-processing and
prediction methods face significant challenges. Machine-learning and
large-language models (LLMs) also have their respective limitations. This paper
explores the application of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning model in
chemical engineering, starting from 30 experimental data points. By integrating
traditional surrogate models like Gaussian processes and random forests with
powerful LLMs such as DeepSeek-R1, a hierarchical architecture is proposed. Two
CoT-building methods, Large Language Model-Chain of Thought (LLM-CoT) and
Machine Learning-Large Language Model-Chain of Thought (ML-LLM-CoT), are
studied. The LLM-CoT combines local models DeepSeek-r1:14b and Qwen2:7b with
Ollama. The ML-LLM-CoT integrates a pre-trained Gaussian ML model with the
LLM-based CoT framework. Our results show that during construction, ML-LLM-CoT
is more efficient. It only has 2 points that require rethink and a total of 4
rethink times, while LLM-CoT has 5 points that need to be re-thought and 34
total rethink times. In predicting the solubility of 20 molecules with
dissimilar structures, the number of molecules with a prediction deviation
higher than 100% for the Gaussian model, LLM-CoT, and ML-LLM-CoT is 7, 6, and
4 respectively. These results indicate that ML-LLM-CoT performs better in
controlling the number of high-deviation molecules, optimizing the average
deviation, and achieving a higher success rate in solubility judgment,
providing a more reliable method for chemical engineering and molecular
property prediction. This study breaks through the limitations of traditional
methods and offers new solutions for rapid property prediction and process
optimization in chemical engineering.

Title: The Paradox of Stochasticity: Limited Creativity and Computational Decoupling in Temperature-Varied LLM Outputs of Structured Fictional Data
Authors: Evgenii Evstafev
Summary: This study examines how temperature settings and model architectures affect
the generation of structured fictional data (names, birthdates) across three
large language models (LLMs): llama3.1:8b, deepseek-r1:8b, and mistral:latest.
By systematically testing temperature values from 0.0 to 1.0 in increments of
0.1, we conducted 330 trials yielding 889 structured entities, validated for
syntactic consistency. Key findings reveal that model architecture
significantly influences computational efficiency, with mistral:latest and
llama3.1:8b processing data 8x faster than deepseek-r1:8b. Contrary to
expectations, temperature showed no correlation with processing time,
challenging assumptions about stochastic sampling costs. Output diversity
remained limited, as models consistently defaulted to common name archetypes
(e.g., 'John Doe' and 'Jane Smith') across all temperatures, though rare names
clustered at intermediate values (0.3-0.7). These results demonstrate that
architectural optimizations, rather than temperature adjustments, dominate
performance in structured generation tasks. The findings emphasize prioritizing
model selection over hyperparameter tuning for efficiency and suggest explicit
diversity constraints are necessary to mitigate default output biases in
synthetic data pipelines.

Title: o3-mini vs DeepSeek-R1: Which One is Safer?
Authors: Aitor Arrieta, Miriam Ugarte, Pablo Valle, Jos√© Antonio Parejo, Sergio Segura
Summary: The irruption of DeepSeek-R1 constitutes a turning point for the AI industry
in general and the LLMs in particular. Its capabilities have demonstrated
outstanding performance in several tasks, including creative thinking, code
generation, maths and automated program repair, at apparently lower execution
cost. However, LLMs must be used with caution, as they can be exploited to
produce harmful content. This paper presents a comparative study between
DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini, two of the most popular LLMs, in terms of safety and
robustness. The study evaluates the models' performance in generating harmful
content, such as hate speech, misinformation, and cyberbullying, and their
resilience to adversarial attacks. The results show that DeepSeek-R1 is more
robust and safer than o3-mini, as it generates less harmful content and is less
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, both models still have room for
improvement in terms of safety and robustness. The paper also discusses the
ethical implications of using LLMs and the need for responsible AI development.

The transformer is a deep learning architecture introduced in the 2017 paper 'Attention is All You Need' by Vaswani et al. It is designed to handle sequential data, such as natural language, and has been particularly successful in the field of natural language processing (NLP). The transformer model uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of input data, allowing it to capture dependencies regardless of their distance in the sequence. This architecture has been instrumental in achieving state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. The transformer model has also inspired numerous variations and extensions, contributing to its widespread adoption in both research and industry. The transformer model consists of an encoder-decoder structure, where both the encoder and decoder are composed of stacked layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each output, making it highly effective for tasks that require understanding context and dependencies. The transformer architecture has several key advantages, including parallelization of training, which makes it more efficient than recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Additionally, the transformer's ability to handle long-range dependencies and its flexibility in processing sequential data have made it a popular choice for a wide range of applications beyond NLP, such as computer vision and speech recognition. In summary, the transformer model represents a significant advancement in deep learning, particularly in the field of NLP. Its innovative use of self-attention mechanisms and encoder-decoder structure has enabled it to achieve state-of-the-art performance in various tasks and has inspired numerous research directions and practical applications.
